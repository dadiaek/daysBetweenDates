# daysBetweenDates
 Another method to calculate the number of days between two dates
 The number of years Leap year = NP (between Year1 and Year2)
 Assuming that the number of days in all years = 365 days Days Between 2 Years 
 From: 01/01/Year1 To: ND = 12/31/Year2
 Total: N = ND + NP
 Number of days before the first date = DB
 Number of days after the second date = DA
 Total days = N - DB - DA
